# Data Structures: Linked Lists

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

- Modify existing LinkedList class to implement a singly linked list.

You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

### Instructions

Your goal for this checkpoint is to get the tests to pass.
To do so, you will be modifying an existing `LinkedList class`.

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assignment.

1. In the `src/linked-list/queue.js` file, implement a complete Queue using only a LinkedList.
2. In the `src/linked-list/removeDuplicates.js` file, implement an algorithm to delete all duplicate values from a sorted linked list. Values may be numbers or strings.
3. In the `src/linked-list/stack.js` file, implement a complete Stack using only a LinkedList.
4. In the `src/queue/parkingLot.js` file, implement a Parking Lot that uses a Queue when the lot is full.
5. In the `src/stack/isPalindrome.js` file, implement an algorithm to check if a string a palindrome using a Stack.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
