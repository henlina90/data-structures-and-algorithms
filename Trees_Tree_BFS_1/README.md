# Trees: BFS

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

- Implement depth-first search traversal of a BST.

## Instructions

Your goal for this checkpoint is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing BinarySearchTree class to add methods that traverse the BST using in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

## Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assignment.

In the `src/BinarySeachTree.js` file, complete the `bfs()` method to visit the BST using a breadth-first search algorithm. You can use the provided `Queue` class in your implementation.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
