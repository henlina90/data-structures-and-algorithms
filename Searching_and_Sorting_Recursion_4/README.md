# Searching and Sorting: Recursion Drills - Fibonacci

In this challenge you will solve a problems using recursion. The objective is to practice using recursion to think about and solve problems. You do not have to worry about the efficiency of your solutions.

## <b>Fibonacci</b>

Write a recursive function that prints the Fibonacci sequence of a given number.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the 2 preceding numbers.

The 0th Fibonacci number is defined as 0 and the 1st Fibonacci number is defined as 1.

For example, the 7th Fibonacci number in a Fibonacci sequence is 13. The sequence looks as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... .
