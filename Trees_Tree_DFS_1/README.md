# Trees: Tree DFS

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

- Implement depth-first search traversal of a BST.

### Instructions</b>

Your goal for this checkpoint is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing `BinarySearchTree` class to add methods that traverse the BST using in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assignment.

In the src/BinarySeachTree.js file, complete the `dfsInOrder()`, `dfsPreOrder()`, and `dfsPostOrder()` methods to visit the BST using in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals, respectively.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
