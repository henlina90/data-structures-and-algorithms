# Trees: Implementation and runtime

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to implement a binary search tree.

## <b>Instructions</b>

Your goal for this checkpoint is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing `BinarySearchTree` class to implement a binary search tree with lookup, insert, and delete capabilities.

## <b>Tasks</b>

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assignment.

In the `src/BinarySeachTree.js` file:

1. Complete the `insert()` method to insert a node into the BST. The method should accept a key and a value as its arguments.

2. Complete the `find()` method which should accept a key as its argument and return the value for the given key in the BST. Throw an `Error()` with a string error message if the node is not found in the BST.

3. Complete the `remove()` method to delete a node with a given key in the BST. Throw an `Error()` with a string error message if the node to be removed is not found in the BST.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
